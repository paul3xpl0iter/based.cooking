Ingredients

    4 tbsp Butter
    2 cups Onions, chopped
    1 lb Mushrooms, sliced
    2 cups Chicken or vegetable stock
    1/2 cup Dry white wine
    2 tsp Dried dill
    2 tsp Fresh thyme

    2 tbsp Soy sauce
    1 cup Milk
    3 tbsp Flour
    1/4 cup Sour cream
    2 tbsp Lemon juice
    2 tbsp Fresh italian parsley

Method

    In a heavy pot or dutch oven saut√© onions and mushrooms in butter over medium heat until onions are soft and translucent, about 15 minutes. Add dill, thyme, paprika, chicken broth, soy sauce and white wine. Bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid reduces by half. In a small bowl, whisk flour into milk until smooth. Add the milk mixture to the soup and cook until the soup begins to thicken, about 10 more minutes.
    Over low heat, slowly stir in the sour cream, and lemon juice until both are completely combined. Garnish the soup with parsley and serve hot.

**Yields 5 cups of soup. If serve 4 people as a main dish, we recommend doubling the recipe.
